Python Data Analysis Review Exercise for 1hr 15mins (tea break about 2:50 is IE time)
====================================

Create a data frame from the following URL:
http://rcs.bu.edu/examples/python/data_analysis/flights.csv
(use pd.read_csv to load this into a df)
df = pd.read_csv('http://rcs.bu.edu/examples/python/data_analysis/flights.csv')

Do the folowing in ANY order:

Show how many rows this data has (hundreds of thousands)
Show the column names and the data types for each column
Show the statistical summaries for the numeric columns in the dataset with df.describe() 
Group the data by airline and show the minimum and mean departure delay for each airline

Use the .agg() method to aggregate min, mean and max delays for departure and arrival
  e.g. df[['dep_delay','arr_delay']].agg(['min','mean','max', 'sum'])

Show the number of flight records
Show the number of unique airlines (nunique)
How many unique aircraft are represented

What was the greatest recorded delay? (show the related data)
What are the mean values for just the first 50 records in the dataset?
What are the mean values for all delays of 15 or more units?

Show a dataframe containing all AA flights that have no missing data members
Show a dataframe containing all flights departing from LGA, grouped by destination
Show a dataframe containing all flights, grouped by airline and sorted by increasing flight duration

On average, which airline is the most punctual (choose one or more interpretation)
- punctuality meaning arrives on time or better
- punctuality meaning departs on time or better
- punctuality meaning arrive and depart on time or better
- punctuality meaning arrive and depart exactly on time
